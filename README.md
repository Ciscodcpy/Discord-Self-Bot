# Discord-Self-Bot
üîß What It Is This is a multi-function Discord user bot (not a bot account) that uses your own Discord user token to perform automated actions. It's controlled from a console interface and offers a list of options for you to choose from.

üìã Main Features
1.Send DM to Specific Members
  -Send a message to one or more user IDs through direct message.

2.Schedule a Message
  -Set a future date/time to automatically send a DM to selected users.

3.Read and Respond to Messages
  -Monitor a specific channel and automatically reply when a keyword appears.

4.Mass Invite to Server
  -Send server invites to multiple users via DM.

5.Send DM with Template
  -Send a customized message using a template and a list of keyword replacements (e.g., "Hi {name}").

6.Exit
  -Cleanly exits the program.

üñ•Ô∏è How You Use It
When the program starts, it shows a menu.
You select an option by entering a number (1‚Äì6).
It asks for additional input like:

-Your user token
-Target user IDs
-Message content or template
-Schedule time or channel ID

Then it performs the action, often using asyncio.run(...) to handle Discord API calls asynchronously.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
This script uses a user token, which goes against Discord's Terms of Service. User bots are not allowed and can result in account termination.

It's a console application, not a GUI or web app.
Uses libraries like:

-discord.py for API interaction
-colorama for colored text in the console
-asyncio for running async functions like sending messages
